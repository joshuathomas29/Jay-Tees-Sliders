9/8 ----
Set up basic menus including difficulty settings which will determine if the picture/number slider is a 3x3 or a 4x4 puzzle

24/8 ----
Started test slider puzzle
implemented grid for easy puzzles (3x3)
I am way behind schedule of where I'd like to be

25/8 ----
successfully populated a 3x3 grid with data from sliderList array
last box still showing "undefined" and messes up positioning if I set to null.
Still behind schedule by about a week. Will need to dedicated more time during the next few weeks.

26/8 ----
Reformatted slider board code as I had a redundant for loop I didn't notice.
Looking for more efficient ways to build slider

27/8 ----
researched "this dot" and changed my entire slider code
created classes with constructors to make sliders
successfully created slider puzzle using static array of colours
slider has keydown events - will look to change to onclick and ontouch events later
attempted to populate slider from data files, unsuccessful

30/8 ----
implemented passing data from separate file into puzzle - will add as parameter later and test if still works
in progress of assigning onclick on individual cells on the player board
onclick working for x direction only so far

1/9 ----
pretty much wiped entire code, started again as my code was turning to spaghetti
implemented slider again with number as text
gave divs onclick successfully to move the elements around the slider

2/9 ----
made a number grid image and spliced it into 9 180x180 images
tested adding all 9 images into divs on sliderboard -- successful
TODO - add onlick to the images to make them work the same as the boxes work right now with text
- finally implement loading game conditions based on difficulty user has selected
- add more images and start testing win conditions
- fix menu buttons and styling etc

4/9 ----
changed images to resize based on gridMultiplier so I can reuse images for both difficulties
onclick added to images, now swap with the empty cell
empty cell changed to hidden to look nicer
added transition times so pieces "animate"
linked the headings through to creating a slider game
game loaded changes based on difficulty selected
added win condition, working
TODO - image sizing needs fine tuning to fit inside box nicely for 3x3 AND 4x4
- source more images to start adding to the game
- splice all images to 3x3 and 4x4s
- add images to data sets
- start planning "hard difficulty game"
- add visual feedback after game is won.

6/9 ----
Implemented colour theory to most aspects of UI
Added second image to test if all functions worked with any picture - successful
Image sizing complete, looks very good on large monitors and smaller screens.
TODO - Still get more images
- Link new menu buttons to different pages
- Media queries for all UI besides the slider

7/9 ----
Refined colour theory
Added all images, spliced into 3x3 and 4x4 and added to data array
Menus updated
Timer and move counter added
Correct and incorrect tile position feedback added
Refined shuffle - added interval to visualize shuffling
Implemented full puzzle forming on win
Win screen shows time taken and moves taken
TODO - Hard Mode

FIRST BUILD COMPLETE
8/9 ----
Hard Mode started
Target numbers are still moving during shuffle
Added check to remove possibility of target number moving
Target numbers do not get onclick listeners
Hard Mode completed and tested - Working, extremely difficult as intended
TODO - "Best Score" display - most likely for any puzzle, not each puzzle, but for each difficulty
- add best score on puzzle screen for something to beat

9/9 ----
Player stats added, best score and time displayed AFTER first game is beat
Best time and moves taken relate to the difficulty the user is playing
Added background music (toggleable) and tap sounds for tile clicks
Added option to play Random slider
Added option to Replay same slider
Disabled tile placement feedback in hard mode
Disabled visualizing shuffle in hard mode as user could see the completed puzzle for a moment.
TODO - Finalize styling, mostly colours. Some boxes are a bit out of proportion though.

13/9 ----
Changed sizing marginally
Added extra information to hard mode
Testing game mechanics thoroughly - no bugs
Game mechanics completed and fully tested.
Tested views for all mobiles in portrait, and tablet for portrait and landscape, all looking good.
TODO - Touch up styling up until submission date.

16/9 ----
Touched up some styling on mobile displays.
