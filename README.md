# Jay-Tees-Sliders
This game will involve classic slider puzzles including images and number puzzles.
Slider puzzles are a proven way to enhance your memory and accelerate your ingenuity!
They also increase the production of dopamine to increase motor skills, concentration power and enhance your recall abilities!
The objective is to arrange the tiles so that they complete the picture for images, or sequence for numbers.
A Hard Mode is included for users wanting to really test their problem solving skills.
They will be required to slide the tile in a way so that they are the sum on the number displayed for that column.
Planning and good arithmetic skills will be helpful as mindlessly sliding the pieces will probably not get you very far!
